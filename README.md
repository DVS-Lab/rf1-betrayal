# Betrayal: Ultimatum Game and Trust Game Data and Analyses

This repository contains analysis code and derivative outputs related to our manuscript,  
**“Linking dACC Responses to Unreciprocated Trust to Brain and Behavior in the Ultimatum Game.”**

All hypotheses and analysis plans were pre-registered on the  
[Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/z6m35/overview).

The goal of this repository is to support transparency and reproducibility of the reported
analyses. With appropriate access to the underlying data, an external user should be able
to reproduce the primary results described in the manuscript.

## Prerequisites and computing environment

Users of this repository are expected to be comfortable working in a Linux environment
and navigating the command line.

Required software includes:
- **FSL** (for fMRI preprocessing and statistical analyses)
- **Bash** (for scripting and pipeline execution)
- **Linux** operating system (local workstation or HPC environment)

Additional dependencies and environment details are documented within individual scripts
as needed.

## Notes on repository organization

This repository does **not** currently contain a full BIDS dataset. Instead, it includes
analysis scripts and selected derivative outputs. Large files and raw imaging data are not
tracked in git.

Tracked directories include:

- `code/`  
  Scripts used to run behavioral and fMRI analyses, including first-, second-, and
  third-level models.

- `derivatives/`  
  Outputs from Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 fMRI analyses. Only selected derivative files
  are tracked; larger outputs can be regenerated by re-running the analysis scripts.

- `masks/`  
  ROI mask files (`.nii.gz`) used in region-of-interest analyses.

- `templates/`  
  FSL `.fsf` template files used to define analysis models.

## Running the analyses

Analyses for this project are executed via a sequence of bash scripts corresponding
to first-, second-, and third-level fMRI analyses.

From the code repository, run the following commands in order:

```bash
bash run_L1stats-ugr.sh
bash run_L2stats-ugr.sh
bash run_L3stats-ugr.sh



## Reproducibility notes

This repository is intended to allow reproduction of reported analyses given access to the
appropriate input data. Some components (e.g., raw imaging data or large intermediate files)
are not included here and may be hosted separately or managed outside of version control.
